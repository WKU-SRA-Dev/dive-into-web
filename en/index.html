            <p> 
                Welcome to the Dark Age of web development! ðŸŒ‘ <br/>

                In this era, everything is thrown into chaos and nonesense! That means there is no frameworks, no paradigm will be introduced, efficient tools have vanished, and JavaScript usage is minimized. We've abandoned design principles and constraints, embarking on a wild coding journey! Weâ€™ve abandoned design principles and development constraints, embracing the wild journey of code! ðŸ¤ª
                
                Here, thereâ€™s no clear structure or perfect architecture, just raw HTML, CSS, and the occasional splash of pure, unfiltered JavaScript. Weâ€™re not relying on complex toolchains; we pursue pure web building, carving our paths through the wilderness of code with the most basic skills. In this era, we intend to only teach you html and css.  
                
                development has no preset paths, and no fancy frameworks to make decisions for you. his is your chance to reclaim control, free from paradigms and rules. Every line of code is a conversation between you and the browserâ€”writing, refreshing, breaking, and fixingâ€”just like in the early days of the web.

                We deploy the website through GitHub Pages, but simply viewing it at d2w.wkusci.com would be a missed opportunity! Look ðŸ‘‰, fork our repository to your local machine, open it in VSCode, and launch the Live Server to truly experience the project!
            </p> 
            <p>
                But is chaos a good choice? For example, our ðŸ‘‰ language switcher doesnâ€™t resize or hide on mobile devices. If you try shrinking your browser window on a desktop, youâ€™ll see the language switcher covering the current content. Do you have a solution for this problem? (Feel free to fork our repository and apply what youâ€™ve learned to fix these behaviors!)

                When setting colors and font sizes, we often feel confused: which color should we choose? Should we use px or rem, and how to decide the size? We are also coding the same componet over and over again. These issues arise one after another, forcousing us to think more deeply about design principles. Inevitably, we start seeking new tools and methods to solve these problems, introducing design paradigms, frameworks, and even development constraints.
                
                As these challenges emerge, we begin moving towards the next era of web development, embracing more systematic solutions. Solving each new problem pushes us forward, gradually leading us out of the "Dark Age" and into a more structured, modular, and efficient development process.
                
                As the course progresses, we will enter the next stage of web development, gradually exploring how to use frameworks, design patterns, and best practices to address these issuesâ€”moving from chaos to order! Stay tuned. At the end of the course, you could submit your polished project to the WKU SRA Dev team for review. We deliberately left some bugs and nonesense in the project for you to refain and fix.
            </p> 
            <p>
                But first, buckle up and get ready to dive into the web as we explore the very essence of web development amidst the chaos! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
