                  CSS is the language that gives your website its unique style. It controls layout, colors, and fonts, making your site visually appealing and easy to navigate. In this section, we'll explore the basics of CSS and how you can use it to style your website.
                  That being said, CSS can be tricky to masterâ€”it's easy to get lost in a sea of properties and values. But don't worry! How about watching Colorcode's videos one by one to get started?

                  I hope you've learned the essentials of web styling from Colorcode's videos! If you're eager to dive deeper into front-end development, you can check out <em>Modern CSS</em> by Joe Attardi. 
                  Looking to explore more on the back-end? I think it is just enough for you to know about CSS.

                    How will our tutorials go on? Just recommond a video is not enough. Teach you how to paint an elephant is foolish, and introduce design philosophy to a beginner is meaningless.
                    So, how about practices by yourself? You need to use  <em>Modern CSS</em> by Joe Attardi as a reference, modify the <code>style.css</code> file we provide to you to see what will happen.
                    All static file is under your current directory, remember, it is not a good to practice to do this, we do this is just for convenience.
                    How to do that? find more information on our <a href="https://github.com/WKU-SRA-Dev/dive-into-web">github repo</a>
